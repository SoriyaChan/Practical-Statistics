# Data and Sampling Distribution

In the era of big data, the principles of random sampling remain important when accurate estimates are needed. Random selection of data can reduce bias and yield a higher quality data set than would result from just using the conveniently available data. Knowledge of various sampling and data generating distributions allows us to quantify potential errors in an estimate that might be due to random variation. At the same time, bootstrap (sampling with replacement from an observed data set) is an attractive "one size fits all" method to determine possible error in sample estimates.

+ Population: The large data set or idea of a data set.
+ Sample: A subset from a larger data set.

+ Sample bias: A sample that misrepresents the population.

+ Random sampling: Drawing elements into a sample at random.
+ Stratified sampling: Dividing the population into strata and randomly sampling from each strata.

+ Information about samples is observed and information about large population is often inferred from smaller samples.

+ Selection bias: Bias resulting from the way in which observations are selected.

+ Sample statistic: A metric calculated for a sample of data drawn from a larger population.
+ Data distribution: The frequency distribution of individual values in a data set.
+ Sampling distribution: The frequency distribution of a sample statistics over many samples or resamples.
+ Standard error: The variability of a sample statistic over many samples.

+ Bootstrap: Create resamples from sample (to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistics, generate confidence intervals, estimate standard error, bagging, ...), it informs us about how lot of additional samples would behave when drawn from a population like our sample.

+ Confidence Interval: Presenting an estimate as a range.

+ Normal distribution: Bell shaped frequency distribution.
+ Standard normal distribution: A normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.

+ QQ-Plot: A plot visualize how close a sample distribution is to a specified distribution, e.g, the normal distribution.

+ Long-Tailed distributions: Data being normal in the middle but having much longer tails.

+ Student's t-distribution: Normally shaped distribution, but it is a bit thicker and longer on the tails.

+ Binomial distribution: Frequency distribution of the number of success (x) in a given number of trials (n) with specified probability (p) of success in each trial.

+ Chi-square distribution: Concerned with counts of subjects or items falling into categories.

+ F-distribution: Used with experiments and linear models involving measured data.

+ Poisson distribution: The frequency distribution of the number of events in sampled units of time or space.

+ Exponential distribution: The frequency distribution of the time or distance from one event to the next event.

+ Weibull distribution: A generalized version of the exponential distribution in which the event rate is allowed to shift over time.
