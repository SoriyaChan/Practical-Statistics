# EDA

The key idea of EDA is that the first and most important step in any project based on data is to look at the data. By summarizing and visualizing the data, you can gain valuable intuition and understanding of the project.

Basic Data types in statistics: Numeric(discrete, continuous), Categorical(binary, ordinal, nominal)

Summary: Location(mean, median,...), Variability(variance, std,...)

Visual (Numeric variables):

+ Boxplot: used to show distributions of numeric data values, especially when you want to compare them between multiple groups.

+ Histogram: a plot of frequency table with the bins on the x-axis and the count (or proportion) on the y-axis.

+ Density plot: a smoothed version of the histogram, often based on kernel density estimate.

+ Correlation heatmap: a graphical tool that displays the correlation between multiple variables as a color-coded matrix.

+ Scatterplot: a plot in which the x-axis is the value of one variable and the y-axis the value of another.

+ Hexagonal binning: a plot of two numeric variables with the record binned into the hexagons.

+ Contour plot: a plot showing the density of two numeric variables like a topographical map.

+ Violin plot: similar to a boxplot but showing the density estimate.

Table (Numeric variables):

+ Frequency table: a tally of count of numeric data values that fall into a set of intervals (bins).

Visual (Categorical variables):

+ Bar chart: the frequency or proportion for each category plotted as bars.

+ Pie chart: the frequency or proportion for each category plotted as wedges in pie.

Table (Categorical variable):

+ Contingency table: A tally of counts between two or more categorical variables.
